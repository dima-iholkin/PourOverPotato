# PourOverPotato app

How do you keep notes on your pour overs?  
This app makes it easy to organize your records.  
I'm using this app daily and actively improving and maintaining it.

## About your data

By design all your data is saved only in your browser on your device, it's not sent anywhere, there is not server. You can import and export your data to and from a file.  
Much later I would like to add an ability to sync data with Google Drive.  

The application is in active development. Things may change and data integrity is not guaranteed. However I'll try hard to not break you data.
