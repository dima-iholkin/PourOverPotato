# PourOverPotato app

How do you keep notes on your pour over brews?  
This app makes it easy to organize your records.  
I'm using this app every day and actively improving and maintaining it.

## About your data

Currently all data is saved only in the user's browser and is not sent anywhere. Later I want to add an ability to import and export data to a file, and sync data with Google Drive.  

This is not a finilized version of the application. Things may change and data integrity is not guaranteed, however I'll try hard to not break you data.
