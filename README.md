# PourOverPotato

Do you brew pour overs?  
How do you organize your records?  

This app is a way to organize the pour over recipes.  
I use this app to brew my pour overs every day. This means I'm invested into maintaining and improving this app.

## About your data

Currently all data is saved only in the user's browser and is not sent anywhere. Later I want to add an ability to import and export data to a file, and sync data with Google Drive.  

This is not a finilized version of the application. Things may change and data integrity is not guaranteed, however I'll try hard to not break you data.
