How do you keep notes on your pour over recipes?  
This app makes it easy to organize your notes.  
I'm using this app daily and actively improving and maintaining it.

## About your data

By design all your data is saved in your browser only and on your device only, it's not sent anywhere, there is no server. You can import and export your data to and from a file.  
Much later I would like to add an ability to sync data with Google Drive.  

The application is in active development. Things may change and data integrity is not guaranteed. However I'll try hard to not break your data.
