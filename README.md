How do you keep notes on your pour over recipes?

[Open the app](https://dima-iholkin.github.io/PourOverPotato/)

This app is used daily. I'm maintaining and improving it when I can.

## About your data

By design all your data is saved in your browser only and on your device only, it's not sent anywhere, there is no server. You can import and export your data to and from a file.  
Much later I would like to add an ability to sync data with Google Drive.  

Unfortunately it's likely that I won't be able to develop the app much more. However it was and is in a very good and usable state since the very early versions long time ago and I will continue using it.
